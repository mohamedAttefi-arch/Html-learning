        <hr>
        <pre>Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same

Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
She's so perfect
Blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love
At least just let me say

That when I talk to you
Oh, cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed staring
Into the blue?
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today

That when I talk to you
Oh, cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start
